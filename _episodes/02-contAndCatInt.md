title: "Linear regression including an interaction between one continuous and one categorical explanatory variable"
objectives:
  - Recognise from an exploratory plot when an interaction between a continuous and a categorical explanatory variable is appropriate. 
  - Fit a linear regression model including an interaction between one continuous and one categorical explanatory variable using `lm()`.
  - Use the jtools package to interpret the model output. 
  - Use the interactions package to visualise the model output.
keypoints:
  - It may be appropriate to include an interaction when the slopes appear to differ across levels of a categorical variable.
  - Replace `+` by `*` in the `lm()` command to add an interaction. 
  - When an interaction is included, two coefficients relate to differences between the two levels of a categorical variable - one relates to a difference in the intercept, the other to a difference in the slope. 
  - The function `interact_plot()` can be used to visualise the model. 
questions:
  - When is it appropriate to add an interaction to a multiple linear regression model?
  - How is an interaction added in the `lm()` command?
  - How do the coefficient estimates given by `summ()` relate to the multiple linear regression model equation?
  - How is the final model visualised in R?

In the previous episode, we modeled the effect of the continuous explanatory variable as equal across the groups of the categorical explanatory variable. For example, the effect of `Weight` on `BMI` was estimated as $0.31$ for both females and males. In this episode we will expand our modelling approach to include an *interaction* between the continuous and categorical explanatory variables. As a result, not only the intercept but also the coefficient of the explanatory variable will differ across the levels of the categorical variable in our model. This is appropriate when the slope in our scatterplot differs between the levels of the categorical variable. 

## Visually exploring the need for an interaction
We will use the variables `BPSysAve`, `Age` and `Sex` as an example. Looking at the scatterplot below, for which the data has been filtered to include participants over the age of 17, it seems that the slope for females is greater than for males.   


~~~
dat %>%
  filter(Age > 17) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = Age, y = BPSysAve, colour = Sex)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.4) +
  ylab("Average systolic blood pressure (mmHg)") +
  xlab("Age (years)")

## Fitting and interpreting a multiple linear regression model with an interaction
The code for fitting our model is similar to the previous `lm()` commands. Notice however that instead of a `+` between the explanatory variables, we use a `*`. This is how we tell `lm()` that we want an interaction between the explanatory variables to be included in the model. The interaction allows the effect of `Age` to differ across the levels of `Sex`. 

In the output from `summ()` we see two coefficients that relate to the baseline level of `Sex`: an intercept and the effect for `Age`. For the alternative level of `Sex`, we see two further coefficients: the difference in the intercept (`Sexmale`) and the difference in the slope (`Age:Sexmale`). The equation for this model therefore becomes:

$$E(\text{Average systolic blood pressure}) = 93.39 + 0.55 \times \text{Age} + 17.06 \times x_2 - 0.28 \times x_2 \times \text{Age}$$,

where $x_2 = 1$ for male participants and $0$ otherwise. 

Since the difference in the intercepts is positive, we expect a greater intercept for males than for females. Furthermore, since the difference in the slopes is negative, we expect a smaller slope for males than for females.

BPSysAve_Age_Sex <- dat %>%
  filter(Age > 17) %>%
  lm(formula = BPSysAve ~ Age * Sex)

## Visualising a multiple linear regression model with an interaction
We can visualise the model, as before, using the `interact_plot()` function.


~~~
interact_plot(BPSysAve_Age_Sex, pred = Age, modx = Sex,
              plot.points = TRUE, point.alpha = 0.4) +
  ylab("Average systolic blood pressure (mmHg)") +
  xlab("Age (years)")
