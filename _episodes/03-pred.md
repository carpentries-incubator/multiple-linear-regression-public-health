As with the simple linear regression model, the multiple linear regression model allows us to make predictions. First we will calculate predictions using the model equation. Then we will see how R can calculate predictions for us using the `make_predictions()` function.

## Calculating predictions manually

Let us use the `BPSysAve_Age_Sex` model from the previous episode. The equation for this model was $E(\text{BPSysAve}) = 93.39 + 0.55 \times \text{Age} + 17.06 \times x_2 - 0.28 \times x_2 \times \text{Age}$, where $x_2 = 1$ for male participants and $0$ otherwise. 

For a 30-year old female, the model predicts an average systolic blood pressure of $E(\text{BPSysAve}) = 93.39 + 0.55 \times 30 + 17.06 \times 0 - 0.28 \times 0 \times 30 = 93.39 + 16.5 = 109.89$.  
For a 30-year old male, the model predicts an average systolic blood pressure of $E(\text{BPSysAve}) = 93.39 + 0.55 \times 30 + 17.06 \times 1 - 0.28 \times 1 \times 30 = 93.39 + 16.5 + 17.06 - 8.4 = 118.55$.

>## Exercise
>Given the `summ` output from our `Hemoglobin_Age_Sex` model, 
>the model can be described
>as $E(\text{Hemoglobin}) = 13.29 + 0.00 \times \text{Age} + 2.76 \times x_2 - 0.02 \times x_2 \times \text{Age}$, where $x_2 = 1$ for participants of the male `Sex` and $0$ otherwise. 
>What level of Hemoglobin does the model predict, on average, 
>for an individual of the female `Sex` with an `Age` of 40? 
> And what Hemoglobin is predicted for a male of the same `Age`?
> > ## Solution
> > For 40-year old females: $13.29 + 0.00 \times 40 + 2.76 \times 0 - 0.02 \times 0 \times 40 = 13.29$.  
> > For 40-year old males: $13.29 + 0.00 \times 40 + 2.76 \times 1 - 0.02 \times 1 \times 40 = 13.29 + 2.76 - 0.8 = 15.25$.

## Making predictions using `make_predictions()`

Using the `make_predictions()` function brings two advantages. First, when calculating multiple predictions, we are saved the effort of inserting multiple values into our model manually and doing the calculations. Secondly, `make_predictions()` returns 95% confidence intervals around the predictions, giving us a sense of the uncertainty around the predictions. 

To use `make_predictions()`, we need to create a `tibble` with the explanatory variable values for which we wish to have mean predictions from the model. We do this using the `tibble()` function. Note that the column names must correspond to the names of the explanatory variables in the model, i.e. `Age` and `Sex`. In the code below, we create a `tibble` with `Age` having the values 30, 40, 50 and 60 for females and males. We then provide `make_predictions()` with this `tibble`, alongside the model from which we wish to have predictions. By default, `make_predicitons()` returns
95% confidence intervals for the mean predictions. 

From the output we can see that the model predicts an average systolic blood pressure of 109.8596 for a 30-year old female. The confidence interval around this prediction is [109.0593, 110.6599].

                        Sex = c("female", "female", "female", "female",
                                "male", "male", "male", "male"))
