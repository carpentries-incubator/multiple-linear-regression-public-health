As with the simple linear regression model, the multiple linear regression model allows us to make predictions. First we will calculate predictions using the model equation. Then we will see how R can calculate predictions for us using the `make_predictions()` function.

## Calculating predictions manually

Let us use the `BPSysAve_Age_Sex` model from the previous episode. The equation for this model was:

$$E(\text{BPSysAve}) = 93.39 + 0.55 \times \text{Age} + 17.06 \times x_2 - 0.28 \times x_2 \times \text{Age}$$, 

where $x_2 = 1$ for male participants and $0$ otherwise. 

For a 30-year old female, the model predicts an average systolic blood pressure of

$$E(\text{BPSysAve}) = 93.39 + 0.55 \times 30 + 17.06 \times 0 - 0.28 \times 0 \times 30 = 93.39 + 16.5 = 109.89$$.  

For a 30-year old male, the model predicts an average systolic blood pressure of

$$E(\text{BPSysAve}) = 93.39 + 0.55 \times 30 + 17.06 \times 1 - 0.28 \times 1 \times 30 = 93.39 + 16.5 + 17.06 - 8.4 = 118.55$$.

## Making predictions using `make_predictions()`

Using the `make_predictions()` function brings two advantages. First, when calculating multiple predictions, we are saved the effort of inserting multiple values into our model manually and doing the calculations. Secondly, `make_predictions()` returns 95% confidence intervals around the predictions, giving us a sense of the uncertainty around the predictions. 

To use `make_predictions()`, we need to create a `tibble` with the explanatory variable values for which we wish to have mean predictions from the model. We do this using the `tibble()` function. Note that the column names must correspond to the names of the explanatory variables in the model, i.e. `Age` and `Sex`. In the code below, we create a `tibble` with `Age` having the values 30, 40, 50 and 60 for females and males. We then provide `make_predictions()` with this `tibble`, alongside the model from which we wish to have predictions. By default, `make_predicitons()` returns
95% confidence intervals for the mean predictions. 

From the output we can see that the model predicts an average systolic blood pressure of 109.8596 for a 30-year old female. The confidence interval around this prediction is [109.0593, 110.6599]. 

```{r predict BPSysAve_Age_Sex}
BPSysAve_Age_Sex <- dat %>%
  filter(Age > 17) %>%
  lm(formula = BPSysAve ~ Age * Sex)

predictionDat <- tibble(Age = c(30, 40, 50, 60,
                                30, 40, 50, 60),
                        Sex = c("female", "female", "female", "female",
                                "male", "male", "male", "male"))

make_predictions(BPSysAve_Age_Sex, new_data = predictionDat)
```

How are these confidence intervals interpreted?
